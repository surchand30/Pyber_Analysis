   ## Conclusion and Recommendations
   
   Based on the analysis and the results obtained, the following recommendations were made to improve profitability of the business and increase its reach :
   
   1) Total number of rides in the Rural cities is significantly lesser than the Urban and Suburban city types. This could be attributed to the lack of drivers in the rural areas. Increasing the number of drivers could potentially increase the number of people using Pyber in the rural cities.
   
   2) Due to lack of drivers in the rural cities, the average fare paid per ride is higher than the Urban and suburban cities. Increasing the number of drivers,could make Pyber more affordable in the rural areas
   
   3) In the case of urban and rural city types, it appears that the month of March seems to be the most profitable. March was not great for the Suburban areas due to fewer rides being taken and less earnings. Moving a few drivers from the suburban cities to the rural and urban cities could drive up the profits and the driver earnings and morale.
   
  4) Ride share programs could also be a big success in the rural cities, where majority of the people fall in the lower income bracket.
